* Log in to the JupyterHub on our training cluster

For this course, we will use a temporary JupyterHub. Here is how to log in:

- Go to {{<a "https://beluu.c3.ca" "https://beluu.c3.ca,">}}
- Sign in with the username & password you just got,
- Set the server options according to the image below,

{{</imgmshadow>}}

#+BEGIN_note
*These are the only values that you should edit:* \\
Change the time to *3.0*
#+END_note

- Press start.

#+BEGIN_note
Note that, unlike other JupyterHubs you might have used (e.g. {{<a "https://syzygy.ca/" "Syzygy">}}), this JupyterHub is not permanent and can only be used for this course.
#+END_note

* Start a Python notebook

To start a Jupyter notebook with the Python kernel, click on the button "Python 3" in the "Notebook" section (top row of buttons).

* Run a notebook that has already be written by an instructor

For some courses, the code already exists in a Jupyter notebook. In those cases, instead of typing the code yourself, all you need to do is:

1. Copy it to your home directory
2. Open it
3. Run it

** Copying a prepared notebook to your home directory

To copy a notebook to your home directory, launch a terminal in JupyterHub by clicking on the "Terminal" button under the "Other" section in the Jupyter launcher (if you don't see the launcher, click on "File" in the top menu and selection "New Launcher" or press Ctrl+Shift+L).

In the terminal, run the code:

#+BEGIN_src sh
cp ~/projects/def-sponsor00/shared/dhsi/xxxx.ipynb .
#+END_src

Replace `xxxx` by the name of the file you need. For instance, for the API Querying course, you will run:

#+BEGIN_src sh
cp ~/projects/def-sponsor00/shared/dhsi/topic_modeling_sonnets_gensim.ipynb .
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_note
Don't forget the dot at the end of this code!
#+END_note

** Open a notebook you just copied

After you run the code above, you should see the notebook appear in the list of your files. To open it, double-click on it.

(If you do not see your files, make sure to go to your home directory by clicking on the folder icon followed by a forward slash).
